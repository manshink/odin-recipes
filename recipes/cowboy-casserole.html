    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul></ul>
        <li>2 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
        <li>8 ounces hot pork country sausage (such as Jimmy Dean)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped garlic</ul>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup (such as Campbell's®)</li>
        <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen corn kernels</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) package frozen tater tots</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fire up the oven, set it to a toasty 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and make sure the rack's chillin' in the center.</li>
        <li>Grab a hefty cast-iron skillet, toss it on medium heat, and drop in some bacon. Stir it up until it's crispy and golden brown, takes about 7 minutes. Scoop it out onto a paper towel-covered plate, save 2 tablespoons of that bacon gold.</li>
        <li>Now, dive into the skillet with diced onions and bell peppers. Let 'em chill in the bacon drippings until they're soft, around 4 minutes. Crank up the heat, toss in ground beef and sausage, stir it up until the beef's all crumbly and browned, about 6-8 minutes. Toss in garlic, let it sizzle for a minute. If there's too much grease, drain it. Now, mix in soup, milk, sour cream, salt, and black pepper. Stir in corn, the reserved bacon, and half a cup of cheese.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top with the remaining cup of cheese and line up those tater tots in sweet concentric circles. You'll have some tots left, stash those for another mission.</li>
        <li>Chuck it in the oven and let it bake until the top's golden brown and the beef mix is bubbling, takes around 35 minutes. Give it a breather for 5 minutes before you dig in. Top it off with a sprinkle of parsley and serve it up hot. You're in for a treat!</li>
    </ol>
