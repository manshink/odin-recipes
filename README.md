Recipe Website Project

Introduction

Welcome to my Recipe Website project! This is a simple HTML website created as part of my learning journey with The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of basic HTML structure, creating links, and organizing content. While the website may not be visually stunning, it serves as a foundation to showcase recipes and navigate between them.

Project Overview

Main Features:

Index Page:

Provides a list of links to various recipes.
Demonstrates the use of HTML elements for creating a structured layout.

Recipe Pages:

Dedicated pages for each recipe linked from the main page.
Includes basic information such as ingredients and instructions.

Technologies and Skills Demonstrated:

HTML: Utilized to create the overall structure of the website.
Linking: Connecting different pages within the website.
Content Organization: Structuring information in a clear and logical manner.

Getting Started

To view the project, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. From the index page, you can navigate to different recipes by clicking on the provided links.

Future Improvements

While this project focuses on the fundamentals, future enhancements could include:

CSS Styling: Adding styles to make the website visually appealing.
